# BMI Calculator Project - Java

## Overview

This is a simple BMI calculator in Java that supports both English (pounds/feet/inches) and Metric (kilograms/centimeters) units. It calculates BMI based on user input and provides a weight status report. The program also generates a table displaying BMI for a range of weights.

## Features

- **Supports English and Metric versions.**
- **BMI Calculation:**
  - English: \[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{(\text{height in inches})^2} \times 703 \]
  - Metric: \[ \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight}}{(\text{height in cm})^2} \times 10000 \]
- **Displays weight status:** Underweight, Healthy Weight, Overweight, or Obesity.
- **Interactive input** for height, weight, and name.
- **Exit option** with `!`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Compile and run `BMI_Master_RochakKadel.java` in your Java IDE or terminal.
